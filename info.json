  "description": "User-defined Favorite/Hotkey locations that you can teleport to\n\nTired of walking and running your game-time-life away? Can't fathom driving a car around your map, avoiding cliffs and lakes? Do you just want to get there already?\n\nWhat if you could simply open a dialog by **right-clicking** on the map view and teleport immediately to that location?\n\n**right-click** and create your tag and mark it as a favorite. That's it!"
