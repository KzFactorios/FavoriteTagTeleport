# Factorio Type Stubs

This folder contains EmmyLua type stubs for Factorio's runtime API, split for maintainability:

- `core.lua`: Core runtime objects and globals (game, global, remote, settings, etc.)
- `gui.lua`: GUI element types
- `misc.lua`: Miscellaneous types (surfaces, forces, items, etc.)
- `events.lua`: Event data stubs

Add new stubs to the appropriate file as needed for static analysis and code completion.
